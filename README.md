# done4today
general assembly group project 3

Done For Today is a web app for people who feel more at home looking up into the stars than they do lounging in their earthly homes. With done4today’s new app, use the interactive and intuitive interface to easily browse through a collection of new and used space ship parts that, when all put together, will allow you to travel the expanse of virtual space. Don’t see the parts you need, search, add, edit, and delete many of components you find. Favorite your parts, add them together, and off you go, whether you are trying to find the planet on which you were probably born, or if your’e just visiting. Includes Authentication and authroization features.

Created, designed, and developed by Mary Mac, Ro, Jonathan Hernandez, and Rico DeRosa, for the GA Software Engineering Immersive (May '19 Cohort) Unit 3 Project.
